When Marks & Spencer's systems went dark over Easter weekend 2025, shoppers couldn't buy their favorite clothes online. Staff couldn't process orders. The company's digital backbone was crippled.

What started as a "technical issue" turned into Britain's costliest retail cyberattack ever. The final bill? A staggering $400 million and counting.

The attackers behind this chaos? A group called Scattered Spider, known for their social engineering skills. They didn't hack their way through firewalls, they simply talked their way into M&S's systems by tricking employees at a third-party contractor.

This isn't just another scary headline. It's a wake-up call for every business using cloud services. The same tactics that brought down one of Britain's most trusted retailers could target your company next.

But here's the good news: most of these attacks are preventable. M&S's nightmare offers clear lessons on what works and what doesn't; when protecting cloud infrastructure from ransomware.

## Why Cloud Attacks Hit Harder Than Ever

The M&S attack wasn't unique. In 2024 alone, ransomware groups collected over $800 million—double the previous year. The average ransom payment jumped from $400,000 to $2 million.

Cloud infrastructure has become the new goldmine for attackers because:


**Your backups become their first target.** Unlike old-school ransomware that just encrypted files, today's groups specifically hunt down your disaster recovery systems. No backups = no choice but to pay.

**Third-party access creates weak links.** M&S learned this the hard way. The attackers didn't target M&S directly—they convinced employees at Tata Consulting Services to hand over access credentials.

**Social engineering beats technical security.** The most sophisticated firewall can't stop someone from simply asking for passwords over the phone.

The scary part? These tactics work because they exploit human psychology, not technical vulnerabilities. That's why traditional security approaches often fall short.

## 7 Steps That Could Have Saved M&S $400 Million

### Step 1: Lock Down Keys access

Here's the uncomfortable truth: M&S got breached because someone had access who shouldn't have.

**The problem:** Many companies give cloud access to a large number of employees and contractors, then fail to check if they still need it. Multiple stories about contracting having elevated rights long after projects end.

**The fix:** Treat cloud access like you would the keys to your safe:
- Require two-factor authentication for everyone, no exceptions
- Give people only the specific permissions they need for their job
- Automatically remove access when people leave or change roles
- Set up time-based access that expires after business hours

**Real example:** If your marketing team only needs to upload files during business hours, why should they have 24/7 access? Simple restrictions like this can stop weekend attacks like the one that hit M&S.

Modern tools can automate much of this process. For instance, CloudAgent.io helps companies continuously monitor and validate their backup systems—the first thing attackers target—ensuring recovery plans work when needed most.

### Step 2: Basic network segmentation goes a long way

Think of your cloud infrastructure like a building. You wouldn't give someone with lobby access the ability to walk into the CEO's office, right?

**The problem:** Most cloud setups are like buildings with no internal doors. Once attackers get inside anywhere, they can access everything.

**The fix:** Create separate "rooms" for different parts of your business:
- Keep customer databases separate from marketing tools
- Isolate development environments from production systems
- Put backup systems in their own locked "vault"

**Why this matters:** When Scattered Spider breached M&S, they could move freely between systems. Better segmentation would have contained the damage to a single area instead of the entire infrastructure.

### Step 3: Make Your Backups Bulletproof

Here's the harsh reality: if attackers can delete or encrypt your backups, you're at their mercy. That's exactly what happened to many companies before M&S.

**The problem:** Traditional backups are sitting ducks. They're often stored in the same systems attackers can access, making them easy targets.

**The fix:** Create "immutable" backups that nobody can modify or delete:
- Store copies in separate cloud regions
- Use backup systems that prevent anyone (including admins) from changing archived data
- Test your backup restoration process monthly, not just when disaster strikes
- Keep some backups completely offline or air-gapped

**Pro tip:** M&S took weeks to restore full operations partly because their recovery plans weren't properly tested. Tools like CloudAgent.io can automatically verify that your backups are working and your recovery procedures will actually restore operations when needed.

### Step 4: Watch for Warning Signs

M&S might have caught the attack earlier if they'd spotted the warning signs. Ransomware groups rarely strike immediately—they usually explore your systems for weeks first.

**What to watch for:**
- Unusual login patterns (like access from new countries or at odd hours)
- Bulk data downloads or file access spikes
- New user accounts created by contractors
- Changes to backup configurations or deletion of security logs

**The key:** Set up automated alerts for these activities. Don't wait for manual reviews that happen once a month.

### Step 5: Train Your People (The Human Firewall)

Remember: M&S wasn't hacked—they were socially engineered. An employee at their contractor was tricked into providing access.

**Essential training topics:**
- How to verify caller identity before providing any information
- Red flags in phishing emails (urgency, unusual requests, grammar mistakes)
- When and how to escalate suspicious contact attempts
- Never provide passwords or access codes over phone or email

**Pro tip:** Run surprise "phishing tests" on your team. Make it educational, not punitive. The goal is building awareness, not catching people.

### Step 6: Have an Emergency Response Plan

When M&S realized they were under attack, they had to figure out their response in real-time. Don't be caught unprepared.

**Your plan should include:**
- Who to call first (internal team, external experts, law enforcement)
- How to isolate infected systems without losing critical data
- Communication templates for customers, employees, and media
- Legal requirements for breach notification in your region

**Important:** Practice your plan with tabletop exercises. Theory doesn't prepare you for the stress of a real attack.

### Step 7: Automate Your Security Monitoring

M&S lost weeks of valuable response time because they didn't catch the attack early enough. In cloud environments, manual security reviews aren't fast enough.

**What to automate:**
- Real-time alerts for suspicious login attempts
- Backup integrity testing (are your backups actually restorable?)
- Access permission reviews (who has what access and do they still need it?)
- Vulnerability scanning across your cloud infrastructure

**The goal:** Catch problems before they become disasters. Automated tools can spot patterns humans miss and respond instantly to threats.

Companies like CloudAgent.io specialize in automating backup testing and cloud security validation—the exact areas where M&S struggled most during their recovery.

## Don't Wait for Your Own $400 Million Wake-Up Call

The M&S attack should terrify every business leader, but it also provides a clear roadmap for protection. The steps above aren't just theoretical—they're battle-tested strategies that could have prevented this disaster.

**The reality check:** Implementing these steps requires effort and investment. But consider the alternative:

- M&S spent $400 million and counting
- They lost customer trust and market value
- Recovery took months, not days
- Their reputation will take years to fully rebuild

**Start today with these quick wins:**
1. Audit who has admin access to your cloud systems
2. Enable two-factor authentication everywhere
3. Test one critical backup restoration this week
4. Create an incident response contact list

**The bottom line:** Ransomware groups like Scattered Spider aren't going away. They're getting smarter, more organized, and more destructive. The question isn't whether your company could be next—it's whether you'll be prepared when they come calling.

The tools and tactics to protect yourself exist today. The only question is whether you'll implement them before or after your own $400 million disaster.
